### What I learned

CSS Styling Techniques:
I've delved into CSS to enhance the layout and readability of web content by adding tabs or spaces. This involved utilizing properties like text-indent and padding to create indentation and spacing, thus improving the overall appearance of the content.

Responsive Design:
By implementing media queries and adhering to responsive design principles, I've learned how to ensure that web pages adapt and display seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. This ensures a smooth user experience regardless of the device being used.

Typography:
Experimenting with different fonts and typography styles, such as integrating Google Fonts, has deepened my understanding of how typography impacts the design aesthetics and readability of a website. It's fascinating to see how the right font choice can significantly enhance the overall look and feel of a web page.

README Creation:
Crafting this README.md file has provided me with valuable experience in effectively communicating project details. From outlining the project's purpose and features to listing the technologies used and providing installation instructions, I've learned the importance of clear and concise documentation for facilitating understanding and collaboration.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h3 class="indented-list">Preparation time</h3>
```
<td class="bold-text">277kcal</td>

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 640px) {
 
}

body.young-serif-regular {
  font-family: "Young Serif", serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on the following areas:

-JavaScript: Strengthening my skills in JavaScript to add more interactivity and dynamic features to my projects.

-CSS Layout: Continuing to explore CSS Flexbox and Grid to improve layout design and responsiveness.

-Backend Development: Learning backend technologies like Node.js to broaden my skill set and develop full-stack applications.

By honing these skills, I aim to create more polished and versatile web projects.


### Useful resources

During the development process, I found the following resources helpful:

-[W3Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com): I frequently referred to W3Schools to look up information on <tables>, @media queries, and other CSS-related topics. Their clear explanations and examples were instrumental in understanding and implementing these concepts.

-[Greeks4Greeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/): I used Greeks4Greeks to research more about @media queries and responsive design techniques. The insights and tutorials provided valuable guidance on creating responsive layouts and optimizing designs for different screen sizes.

These resources played a significant role in my learning journey and were instrumental in achieving the desired functionality and aesthetics for the project.
